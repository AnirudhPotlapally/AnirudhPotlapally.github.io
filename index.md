## Experience
### Research Intern at International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (July 2019-July 2021)
#### Text recognition from Embossed On-Video Metadata obtained from UAVs
 - Developed an end-to-end application to recognise text embossed on videos captured by UAVs.
 - Created an annotation tool to extract frames from videos and generate groundtruth of the embossed characters.

#### Time Series Classification of Spatio-Temporal Satellite Data – A Deep Learning Experiment
 - Performed an in-depth review on target areas of research and applications of Deep Learning in Remote Sensing.
 - Researched  Time Series Analysis and Classification in Remote Sensing Imagery.
 - Worked on understanding the history of the Land Use by analyzing Time Series of pixel intensities of common objects in Land Use & Land Cover (LULC) data and built models to classify them to automate the analysis.
 - Data source: Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery, obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), NASA.
- Created models for classifying time series using LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM, Bidirectional GRU, CNN-LSTM and 1DConvNets, and evaluated  the results.

### Research Intern at National Remote Sensing Centre - Indian Space Research Organization (NRSC-ISRO) May 2018-July 2018 & Feb 2019-June 2019

#### Object Detection in Satellite Imagery for Multiple Resolutions and Sensors
- Evaluated the performance of multiple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models such as Single Shot Detector, Fast R-CNN, YOLOV2 and Faster R-CNN.
- Built a model using pre-trained “faster_rcnn_inception_v2” from Tensorflow’s Object Detection API and evaluated in accordance to the PASCAL VOC standards.

#### Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Imagery using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks                
- Built a model for instance segmentation using Mask R-CNN.
- Model tuning: 
  - Compared different backbone extractors and selected ResNet101 for feature extraction.
  - Performed selective training of each layer of the networks with appropriate learning rates.
- Evaluated the model according to Common Objects in Context (COCO) standards.
